apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

# Test cluster components installed in order:
# 1. Tekton Pipelines - for TaskRun execution
# 2. Knative Serving - for the knative service runtime
# 3. Knative Eventing - for event sources and triggers
# 4. Snapshot CRD - for application snapshot resources
# 5. Registry - for container image storage
# 6. Default Broker - for event routing

resources:
  # Tekton Pipelines v1.6.0 - Matches go.mod dependency version
  # Uses newer image repositories with better availability
  - https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v1.6.0/release.yaml

  # NOTE: Knative Serving and Eventing are installed separately in kind.go
  # to avoid duplicate CRD issues with kustomize remote resource merging

  # Custom resources
  - snapshot-crd.yaml
  - releaseplan-crd.yaml
  - releaseplanadmission-crd.yaml
  - ../registry

# NOTE: default-broker.yaml and Kourier networking configuration are applied
# separately in kind.go after Knative Eventing and Serving are installed
# NOTE: Stub Task is deployed with service resources in config/test to ensure
# it's in the same namespace as the TaskRuns
