kind: Kustomization

# Test cluster components installed in order:
# 1. Knative Serving - for the knative service runtime
# 2. Knative Eventing - for event sources and triggers
# 3. Custom CRDs - for application resources (Snapshot, ReleasePlan, etc.)
# 4. Registry - for container image storage
# 5. Default Broker - for event routing

resources:
  # NOTE: Knative Serving and Eventing are installed separately in kind.go
  # to avoid duplicate CRD issues with kustomize remote resource merging

  # Custom resources
  - snapshot-crd.yaml
  - releaseplan-crd.yaml
  - releaseplanadmission-crd.yaml
  - ../registry

# NOTE: default-broker.yaml and Kourier networking configuration are applied
# separately in kind.go after Knative Eventing and Serving are installed
